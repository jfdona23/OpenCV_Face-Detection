# This place is intended to keep my Face Detection practices.

Some concepts:
* __Face detection:__ Detect wether or not there is a face in the image.
* __Face recognition:__ Match the detected faces with a person.
* __Face analysis:__ Gather data bout the recognized face (age, gender, emotions).
* __Haar cascade clasifier:__ Patterns to detect constrast differences. Useful to find faces.\
